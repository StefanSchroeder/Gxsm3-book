\chapter{\Gxsm\ Quick Start Guide}
\label{cha:Gxsm-quick}
\index{Quickstart}
In this chapter, we will briefly described to configure \Gxsm\ after installation to operate one of SoftdB's Open Source SPM controller, i.e. MK2-A810 or MK3Pro-PLL. Please, make sure that you have installed a recent version of \Gxsm\ and the proper kernel modules before continuing. For further instructions to install \Gxsm\ see Chap.~\ref{cha:Gxsm-install}. There is also a Chap. explaining how to upload the DSP binary to your Open Source SPM controller.

\GxsmHint{In case, you want to start over with `fresh' settings, please follow the instructions below in Sec.~\ref{sec:Gxsm-quick-ResetingSettings}}

\section{Storing and Restoring Settings}
\label{sec:Gxsm-quick-StoringSettings}
\index{Settings!Store}
\index{Settings!Restore}
To save and archive/backup simply do this to save it in a file named for example gxsm3-dconf-dump:\\ \\
\GxsmCmd{dconf dump /org/gnome/gxsm3/ $>$ gxsm3-dconf-dump}\\ \\
and to restore simply read it back -- sure this will overwrite any current settings:\\\\
\GxsmCmd{dconf load /org/gnome/gxsm3/ $>$ gxsm3-dconf-dump}\\
\GxsmNote{It is strongly adviced to exit \Gxsm\ while storing/restoring settings.}

To manually inspect it you may use (sure with caution) the dconf-editor as well.

\section{Delete Settings}
\label{sec:Gxsm-quick-ResetingSettings}
\index{Settings!Reset}

If required you can delete all settings stored by \Gxsm\ in the dconf by\\ \\
\GxsmCmd{dconf reset -f /org/gnome/gxsm3/}
\GxsmNote{The / at the command is important to manipulate the whole tree and not just a single entry.}
